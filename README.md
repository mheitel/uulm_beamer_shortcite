# LaTeX Beamer Template for Ulm University talks using a short cite command

This repository provides a simple and clean template for LaTeX Beamer presentations with the Ulm University logo and colors. Furthermore, we provide a new cite command 
```
footshortcite{key}
```
similar to the biblatex's footfullcite and a command similar to biblatex's footcitetext. 
```
footshortcitetext{key}
```
The footnotes only print minimum info for the cites.

## Getting Started

Download the complete repository and compile the main.tex file with lualatex.

### Prerequisites

You need a proper installation of LaTeX.
